# Contributing to typetracer

## Opening issues

The easiest way to note any behavioural curiosities or to request any new
features is by opening a [github issue](https://github.com/mpadge/typetracer/issues).


## Development guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes to `typetracer`, we use [the GitHub
flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for proposing,
submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. If you haven't done this before,
there's a nice overview of git [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html), as well
as best practices for submitting pull requests
[here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#pr-make).
