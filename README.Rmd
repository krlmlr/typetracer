# typetracer

Trace function parameter types in R packages.

```{r}
library (typetracer)
```


## Example

Define a function, and use `inject_tracer` to inject parameter tracers used to
trace parameter types on each call.

```{r inject}
f <- function (x, y) {
    x * x + y * y
}
inject_tracer (f, .GlobalEnv)
```

Calls to the function, `f`, will then dump traces to a file in the temporary
directory associated with the R process used to load the `typetracer` package.
This ensures that traces will still work even when called in multi-threaded
processes. The following code shows an example call to the `f` function, and
subsequent extraction of the traces. Current demo-only version only traces
`storage.type` and `length`.

```{r read-trace}
val <- f (x = 1:2, y = 3:4 + 0.)
load_traces ()
```
